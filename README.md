This program fetches the closing values
for a given ticker over the past month
and displays them as a Line chart.

## Built With:
1. [React](https://react.dev/)
2. Tailwind CSS ([Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/))
3. [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (Backend + Database)
4. [Recharts library](https://recharts.org/en-US/) for animated graphs
5. [TwelveData API](https://twelvedata.com/docs#batch-requests) for fetching stock data
7. [BeautifulSoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)  for web-scraping

## Planned Enhancements:
1. Implement a 'favorite ticker' functionality
2. Allow the users to share their favorite
    tickers (creating a watchlist with others)
